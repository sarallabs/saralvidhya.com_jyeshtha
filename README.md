## 🌟 Key Features

1. **Adaptive Viewport Layout:** Content sections are highly responsive, utilizing tailored padding and grid structures to perfectly fit standard monitor viewports without aggressive scrolling.
2. **Cinematic Animations:** Uses `Framer Motion` for staggered group reveals, 3D card tilt effects, parallax scrolling, and animated gradient orbs.
3. **Component-Driven UI:** Everything is modularized. The UI is split intelligently into specific components (`Hero.tsx`, `Sections.tsx`) allowing for high maintainability.
4. **Edge-Ready Serverless Design:** Pre-configured for Cloudflare deployment, meaning sub-millisecond routing and Server-Side Rendering capabilities at the edge.
